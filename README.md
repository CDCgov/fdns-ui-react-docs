# FDNS React UI Library Documentation
This project includes documentation for the FDNS React UI Library. The purpose of this app is to provide a visualization and documentation of all the components created using the [fdns-ui-react](https://github.com/cdcgov/fdns-ui-react) library. This app can be used as a way of perusing the existing components or as a means to view how updates to the `fdns-ui-react` library affect these components.
